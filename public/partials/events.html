The rise and development has been, and should be, attributed to the rise of the opensource: collaborative, collective effort from developers, thinkers and innovators from all around the world.</p><p>In this event, you will be required to develop a website that adheres to the standards of the present. A website which can truly be said to be of the year 2018.</p><p>The event will be held in two stages: a preliminary round followed by the on-site event.</p><h3>Preliminary Round</h3><p>A 'New Tab' page is one which everyone is familiar with. The default page that opens on most browsers, probably displaying your 'Most Visited' links, a search bar and others gimmicks. You are to redesign and build a 'New Tab' page with at least one new functionality. This is akin to installing an Extension or Add-on that changes your New Tab.</p><h3>Submission</h3><ul><li>The project should be zipped and emailed to web@projectbeta.tech.</li><li><strong>Deadline: 10th August 2018, 0000hrs.</strong></li><li>8 teams will be selected for the on-site event.</li></ul><h3>Rules</h3><ul><li>Use of external, open source JavaScript libraries and frameworks (React, Vue etc.) for functionalities within the New Tab is allowed and encouraged.</li><li>External libraries/frameworks for CSS are NOT allowed. These include CSS libraries like Bootstrap.</li><li>Use of modern Javascript (ES6 and above) is appreciated.</li></ul><h3>On-site Round</h3><p>Tasks for the on-site round will be announced then and there. Every team will be provided with 2 workstations connected to the internet, and loaded with:</p><ul><li>Git, Node (includes npm)</li><li>Sublime Text 3</li><li>Photoshop, Illustrator, GIMP</li></ul><h3>Judgement</h3><p>Your project will be judged individually, and wholly.

Groups are not limited to any genre, scale, time signature etc, and can use any plugins they have access to. Please specify the genre of the track you send.

For the semi-finals and finals, teams will get 45 minutes each to produce their track.</p><p>All teams are expected to get their own laptops/ PCs/peripherals and use only the plugins specified by us. The software to be used for producing the tracks is FL Studio 12. The quarter finals will have a definite genre and other predefined specificatons. The semis and finals will have some surprises. We expect schools to be well versed in conventional genres, as well some offbeat ones. </p><p>Before submitting the tracks in the round, each team must show one of the judges the original (.flp) file for a pre-screening to ensure no restricted plugins, instruments or sample packs have been used in the production of the track.</p><p>To level the playing field, we will standardize the production process. Only those plugins, virtual instruments/synths, samples and packs, that are mentioned in the rules documentation are permitted to be used in producing your tracks (this is applicable only for the knockout rounds, not the prelims).</p><h3>Judgement Criteria</h3><p>Participants will be judged on:</p><ul><li>General audio quality</li><li>Choice of plugins, samples, and techniques</li><li>Compositional techniques (melody and harmony, scales, etc.)</li><li>End result and feel of the track</li></ul></div></div></div><a ui-sref="home">â†¤ Home</a><script>var eventSections = document.querySelectorAll('.section .content');
